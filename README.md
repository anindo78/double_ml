### Intro to Double ML

Predictive models e.g. XGBoost coupled with ML Interpretability models e.g. SHAP are powerful. But they are only useful for:
1. Predictions
2. Relationship between inputs and outcomes
3. Diagnosis of potential problems

Predictive models should not be used for 'decision making'. Since predictive models are **not causal**!!
Predictive models implicitly assume that everyone will keep behaving the same way in the future, and therefore correlation patterns will stay constant. But they do **not model behavior**.

## Example: Subscriber Retention
#### Predicts whether a customer will renew their product subscription

Let us assume there are the following drivers we have already found:
1. customer discount
2. ad spending
3. customerâ€™s monthly usage
4. last upgrade
5. bugs reported by a customer
6. interactions with a customer
7. sales calls with a customer
8. macroeconomic activity.
