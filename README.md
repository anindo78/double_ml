### Intro to Double ML

Predictive models e.g. XGBoost coupled with ML Interpretability models e.g. SHAP are powerful. But they are only useful for:
1. Predictions
2. Relationship between inputs and outcomes
3. Diagnosis of potential problems

Predictive models should not be used for 'decision making'. Since predictive models are **not causal**!!
